    "Le $M$ be a matching of graph $G$, and $p = \\nu(G)$ be the maximum cardinality of a matching of G. Let $K$ be the number of node-disjoint $M$-augmenting paths. We need to prove that $K \\geq p - |M|$.\n",

    "- node-disjoint paths of G\n",
    "\n",
    "Because $N, M$ are matchings, any path in $J$ alternates between $M$ and $N$. Based on this, we can say that the number of edges in $M$ and $N$ are equal for circuits in $J$, and paths of $J$ which have even number of edges. Furthermore, we observe that for every odd-length path in $J$, because the path is alternating, the number of edges in $N$ and $M$ differ by 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $P$ be a path in $J$, and let $m(P), n(P)$ be the number of edges in $M, N$ respectively. For every $P$ such that $n(P) = m(P) + 1$, $P$ is an $M$-augmenting path because the $N$ edges sandwich the $M$ edges at the ends, and end-nodes are $M$-exposed. Also, using $P$ to augment $M$ (by setting $M' = M \\Delta E(P)$) increases the matching size by 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let the disrepancy between $N$ and $M$ be $k = |N| - |M| = p - |M|$. Then we need to augment $M$ by $k$ times to reach a maximum matching. But how do we know that there exists $k$ available $M$-augmenting paths? Well, when we take the symmetric difference as above ($J = N\\Delta M$), the extra $N$ edges will only appear in paths $P$ where $n(P) = m(P) + 1$. These are $M$-augmenting paths as shown above. There can be leftover unused $M$-augmenting paths in the case where $n(P) + 1 = m(P)$; any such paths in $J$ 'cancel' contributions from $M$-augmenting paths. Because of this, $k$, the number of $M$-augmenting paths needed to reach $p$ can be less than the total number of $M$-augmenting paths, $K$ in $J$. So $K \\geq k = p - |M|$."

    "The question defines $p$ as the cardinality of a maximum-matching in $G$. $M$ is a matching of at most cardinality $p - \\sqrt{p}$. Let $m(P)$ be the number of edges of path $P$ that belong in $M$. We can convert the problem statement into the logical expression:\n",

Next, exercise [#3](#Exercise-3) states that there are at least $p - |M|$ node-disjoint $M$-augmenting paths. Let us denote the number of $M$-augmenting paths as $k \\gt p - |M|$. The total $M$-edges in all these paths are upper-bounded by $|M|$. This total number $T$ of $M$-edges is lower-bounded by all paths having the same number of $M$-edges greater than $\\sqrt{p}$.
