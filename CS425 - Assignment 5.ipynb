    "Let $x$ be the integral feasible flow corresponding to the matching $M$ of the bipartite graph $G$. Because $G$ is bipartite, it is composed of partitions $P$ and $Q$, and we can construct a max-flow graph $G'$ as discussed in lecture (nodes of $P$ and $Q$, arcs connecting $P$ to $Q$ along edges in $G$, and a source node $r$, a sink node $s$ with capacities:\n",
    "\n",
    "$u_{rp} = 1\\ \\forall\\ p\\in P\\\\ u_{pq} = \\infty\\ \\forall\\ p\\in P, q\\in Q, pq \\in E(G)\\\\ u_{qs} = 1\\ \\forall\\ q\\in Q$\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us denote the set of nodes of $P$ and $Q$ that are exposed by $M$ as $P', Q'$ respectively. For an $(r,s)$-path to be considered an $x$-augmenting path, it needs to have:\n",
    "- $x_e < u_e\\ \\forall \\textrm{ forward arcs in the path}$\n",
    "- $x_e > 0\\ \\forall \\textrm{ reverse arcs in the path}$\n",
    "\n",
    "However, we note that there are no $(r,s)$-paths in $G'$ with reverse arcs, so finding a path where the flow is less than the capacity is enough. Next, we know that the $(r, s)$-paths with flow along them are already at capacity 1 (by the integral nature of $u$); these correspond with $pq$ matches in $M$. Therefore, only $(r,s)$-paths connecting $P'$ and $Q'$ are available. Because these have no flow on them ($x$ only covers $pq$ pairs in $M$), and they represent an $(r,s)$-path ($rp-pq-qs$ where $pq \\notin M$), these are by definition $x$-augmenting paths. Because $p \\in P'$ and $q \\in Q'$, this $x$-augmenting path contains an exposed $pq$ pair, and this $pq$ arc is an $M$-augmenting path because its endpoints in $G$ are exposed by $M$; this $pq$ is thus an $M$-augmenting path as well."

    "Le $M$ be a matching of graph $G$, and $p = \\nu(G)$ be the maximum cardinality of a matching of G. Let $K$ be the number of node-disjoint $M$-augmenting paths. We need to prove that $K \\geq p - |M|$.\n",

    "Because $N, M$ are matchings, any path in $J$ alternates between $M$ and $N$. Based on this, we can say that the number of edges in $M$ and $N$ are equal for circuits in $J$, and paths of $J$ which have even number of edges. Furthermore, we observe that for every odd-length path in $J$, because the path is alternating, the number of edges in $N$ and $M$ differ by 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $P$ be a path in $J$, and let $m(P), n(P)$ be the number of edges in $M, N$ respectively. For every $P$ such that $n(P) = m(P) + 1$, $P$ is an $M$-augmenting path because the $N$ edges sandwich the $M$ edges at the ends, and end-nodes are $M$-exposed. Also, using $P$ to augment $M$ (by setting $M' = M \\Delta E(P)$) increases the matching size by 1.\n",

    "Let the disrepancy between $N$ and $M$ be $k = |N| - |M| = p - |M|$. Then we need to augment $M$ by $k$ times to reach a maximum matching. But how do we know that there exists $k$ available $M$-augmenting paths? Well, when we take the symmetric difference as above ($J = N\\Delta M$), the extra $N$ edges will only appear in paths $P$ where $n(P) = m(P) + 1$. These are $M$-augmenting paths as shown above. There can be leftover unused $M$-augmenting paths in the case where $n(P) + 1 = m(P)$; any such paths in $J$ 'cancel' contributions from $M$-augmenting paths. Because of this, $k$, the number of $M$-augmenting paths needed to reach $p$ can be less than the total number of $M$-augmenting paths, $K$ in $J$. So $K \\geq k = p - |M|$."
